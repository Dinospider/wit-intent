# wit-intent

It takes user input and responds after categorizing text into intents. The intents may be of four types – weather, distance, directions, and time taken.

## Working

A wit app was created at wit, and the app was trained to recognize text and categorize them into four intents. 
The user input is accepted and is sent to the wit app using wit’s message API.
The wit app responds with the intent, if found.
